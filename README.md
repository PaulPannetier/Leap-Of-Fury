Leap of Fury is a party game for 2 to 4 players, where each player must defeat their opponents in a chaotic arena using their character’s spells and abilities.
Five unique characters are currently available, along with 20 maps—each featuring its own mechanics and gameplay.
The core gameplay innovation lies in the arena design: instead of traditional square maps, the arenas are toric—meaning the left and right edges are connected, as are the top and bottom, creating a looping world.
The game is built with Unity for rendering, but physics and collision are handled by a custom-made system specifically designed to support the toric arena structure.
